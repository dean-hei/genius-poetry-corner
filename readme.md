# P4: Lyrical (Genius Poetry Corner)


![](readme-pics/results.png)

Lyrical allows users to search for lyrics of their favorite songs and add individual lyrics to poems they have created. Essentially, a user can create poetry using different song lyrics.

## Tech Stack
**Front end:** React

**Back end:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy (PostGreSQL)

**APIs:** Genius API ([link](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1))

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Song Lyrics API

This app also functions as an API to get song lyrics from Genius. The Genius API provides information about a song, but not the actual lyrics. You can use my API to get Genius song lyrics as a JSON by following this address format:

|Description|Example|
|-------|------|
|1. Lyrical Poetry Heroku address| https://lyrical-poetry.herokuapp.com/songs/|
|2. Author separated by dashes | nombe|
|3. Song title separated by dashes | -miss-mirage|
|4. "Lyrics" | -lyrics |

#### Example: [https://lyrical-poetry.herokuapp.com/songs/nombe-miss-mirage-lyrics](https://lyrical-poetry.herokuapp.com/songs/nombe-miss-mirage-lyrics)

## Installation Instructions

Fork and clone this repo to your local library.

### Back End: Flask

1. Install python dependencies as listed in "requirements.txt" via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure you have PSQL running (the default database will be "postgresql://localhost/lyrical")
3. Enter the following commands to run the flask server:
`export FLASK_APP=app.py`
`export FLASK_ENV=development`
`flask run`
4. The server should now be running at the default port for flask is localhost:5000. 

### Front End: React w/ Yarn

1. Navigate into the client folder with `cd client`
2. Install dependencies for yarn with `yarn`
3. Create a .env file with `touch .env` and in it, add these lines:
`REACT_APP_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:5000/"`
`REACT_APP_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR TOKEN HERE"`
4. To get an access token for the Genius API, create an account [here](https://genius.com/api-clients)
5. Generate a client access token and copy/paste it into the .env file
6. Run the client-side server with `yarn start`
7. The browser will open up the client on localhost:3000.

## Tech

### Genius API
1. Using a user's query from searchbar, the Genius API is queried to show a list of songs in /results
2. Each song result will have a generic http path to the lyrics page. This path is passed to the back end.
3. Backend uses python data scraping to get the lyrics and return them to the front end page, /results/:id
4. Front end renders song lyrics from back end, with artist and title

	- [Luckily, someone already wrote the script for it](https://bigishdata.com/2016/09/27/getting-song-lyrics-from-geniuss-api-scraping/)

### Tuesday
